\section{Introduction} 
\label{sec:introduction} 
\subsection{Problem Background}
The United States is facing a national wide problem of increasing use of synthetic and non-synthetic opioids. The uses of drugs are either for the treatment or management of pain, which is certainly a legal prescription use, or for the recreational purposes, which are illegal and non-prescription use. The use of opioids will endanger life and personal property as using opioids disorderly may cause hepatitis, HIV infection, and also neonatal abstinence syndrome, federal organizations and federal government are trying their best to ``save lives and prevent negative health effects of this epidemic''.[1] Thus, for the purpose of countering the opioids crisis, in this paper we will: \begin{itemize}
    \item Use the NFLIS data provided to model the spread and characteristics of the reported synthetic opioids and heroin incidents in and between the five states, Ohio, Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia, and Pennsylvania, and their counties over time.
    \item Use the U.S Census socio-economic data provided to solve
    \item Identify strategies for countering the opioids crisis.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Previous Research}

\subsection{Our work}
In this solution, we first build the model of the spread and characteristics of synthetic opioids and heroin from the year 2010 to 2017 with the provided NFLIS data, and evaluate all possible places in each states that might be the origin of the drugs or narcotic analgesics. Then we build models to ...
The next task we do is giving our strategies for countering the opioids crisis.

\section{Assumptions} 

\begin{itemize}
    \item The country location data are correct as provided.
    
    \item The drug can only be transferred by contact physically.
    
    \item Since the rate of drug relapse is relatively high (about 85$\%$) within a year after drug treatment action, we assume that once one got addicted to drugs, he or she will constantly be dependent on drugs.
    % remember to reference the 85% data.
\end{itemize}

\section{Spread and Characteristics of Synthetic Opioids and Herion Incidents}

In this section, we are going to build a model to describe and predict the trend of the drug usage in the 5 states we are focusing on. First we organized the data provided such that we separated the incidents of synthetic opiods, heroin and other types of drug. For heroin and synthetic opioids, we did a heat map for the number of drug reports within the 5 states from year 2010 to 2017 respectively. Using these graphs, we can easily visualize the trends of drug usage and trace its development over the years. Then we construct %%%%%%%%some model%%%%%%%%%%
such that we are able to predict the trend in the next %several
years.
